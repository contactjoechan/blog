# How to share folders to your network from Linux

# Install Samba
```sudo apt-get install samba -y```
Start the service
```sudo systemctl enable --now smbd```

# Create the share
```sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf```

[Public]
```
path = /home/USER/Public
browserable = yes
writable = yes
read only = no
force create mode = 0666
force directory mode = 0777
```
WHERE USER is the username

File server example
```
[share01FileServer]
    comment = Ubuntu File Server Share
    path = /srv/samba/share
    browsable = yes
    guest ok = yes
    read only = no
    create mask = 0777
```

# Restart Samba Service
```sudo systemctl restart smbd```

# Config the firewall
firewall-cmd --add-service=samba --permanent

# Enable User
```sudo adduser guestshare```
WHERE guestshare is the username

```
sudo smbpasswd -a guestshare # add the user to Samba service
sudo smbpasswd -e guestshare # enable the user to use Samba service
```

# In Windows File Explorer
\\192.168.1.xx
WHICH is the ip address of the Linux sharing folder by Samba service

Type the user credential created above, for example guestshare, to access the home directory of the shared folder, which is Public in our example.
